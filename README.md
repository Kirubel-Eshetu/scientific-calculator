# Scientific_Calculator
## A Scientific Calculator built with C➕➕

✖️ A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help calculate science, engineering, and 
mathematics problems containing a variety of operations like Trigonometric function, Logarithmic function,
Factorial.

📽️ This project is to create a scientific calculator using C➕➕. On this project fundamental concepts of C➕➕ were used including
functions, loops, libraries and switch statements.

1️⃣5️⃣ The built scientific calculator can perform 15 distnict operations which are: - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponent, Square root, Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Inverse of sine, Inverse of Cosine, Inverse of Tangent, Lograrithm, Logarithm with base 10 and Factorial.

🗄️ io stream and cmath Header files were used through out the project. cmath allows to use pre-defined C➕➕ mathematical 
functions. Switch is a type of selective statement which allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each 
value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

⌨️ The total cases of the code are 15. When the input value(c) lies between 1️⃣ and 1️⃣5️⃣ the program
takes the value as case number and performs specific operations based on the following format:

      1 = Addition
      2 = Subtraction
      3 = Multiplication
      4 = Division    
      5 = Exponent
      6 = Square root
      7 = Sine
      8 = Cosine
      9 = Tangent
      10 = Inverse of Sine
      11 = Inverse of Cosine
      12 = Inverse of Tangent
      13 = Logarithm
      14 = Logarithm with base 10
      15 = Factorial

⛔ When 0️⃣ is recieved as input, the calculator terminates.
